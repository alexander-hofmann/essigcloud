V0.0.1	
Subproject essigbox features 
	- measure temp every 2 seconds 
	- displays temp on a display

V0.0.2
Subproject essigbox features
	- measure humidity every 2 seconds
	- display humidity on a display with temperature

V0.1.0
Subproject essigbox features
	- add pin 5,6,7 as relais for the heating cables 1,2,3
	- just implement the correct order of the plugins
	- relais might switch when pin is LOW or HIGH

V0.2.0
Subproject rxtx2mqtt
	- esp8266 breakout board is used for data exchange between 
	  a mqtt server and an arduino, attached to rxtx of the 
	  esp8266
	- define rxtx protocol 256 bytes max, key=value pairs, 
	  key defines the mqtt topic and value is the message to
	  transmit
	- each rxtx message is seperated by \n
	- parse readed rx, each line is one value, read keys and values seperated by =-sign
	- send values immediately to mqtt
V0.2.1
Subproject rxtx2mqtt
	- register topics to listen on, <topic>?
	- topic will be observed then
	- on receive of a mqtt message of this topic send the message <topic>=<message>\n to the
	  attached arduino over serial
V0.2.2
Subproject essigbox features
	- use SoftwareSerial to send temp and humidity to MQTT server through rxtx2mqtt
	- use topic home/essigcloud/essigbox01/temp for temp and
	- use topic home/essigcloud/essigbox01/humidity for humidity
